In this project, I developed an interactive and dynamic dashboard designed to track and analyze online sales data, delivering valuable insights for informed decision-making. I processed and transformed the data by utilizing advanced parameters, custom calculations, and table joins to create visualizations tailored to user needs and enable comprehensive analysis. I incorporated a range of visuals, such as bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots, to present the data in a clear and engaging way. Additionally, I implemented drill-downs and custom filters to uncover trends, analyze monthly profits, examine customer behavior, and assess regional performance.
